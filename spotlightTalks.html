<p><span style="font-size: 18pt;"><strong>General Instructions</strong></span></p>
<p><strong> Spotlight Talk</strong></p>
<p>Slides:<br />&bull; Fonts should be large enough.<br />&bull; Don&rsquo;t use light colors like yellow or green, they are usually not that visible.<br />&bull; Use figures and/or animations to visualize the ideas.<br />&bull; Everything that is on the slides should be explained.<br />&bull; Have your slides ready at least 2 days before your presentation and upload them on Canvas.</p>
<p>Presentation (5-7 minutes in total):<br />&bull; Spend some time on introducing the problem to the audience and motivate why this research is important (1-2 slides, 1-2 minutes).<br />&bull; Summarise the main aspects of the paper (2-3 slides, 3-4 minutes).<br />&bull; Use 1 slide to state what you liked (or didn&rsquo;t like) about the paper (1 minute).<br />&bull; Practice the presentation at least twice in front of other students before the spotlight talk and incorporate feedback.</p>
<p><strong>Essay</strong><br />&bull; Each essay has to be 5-7 pages (excluding references) in Springer LNCS style using Latex.<br />&bull; Motivate the topic and review relevant literature (1-2 pages).<br />&bull; Summarize the novelty of the paper and compare it to previous approaches (2 pages).<br />&bull; What future work would you suggest to do based on the results presented in the paper? (1 page).<br />&bull; Do a critical review of the paper. What is interesting about the paper? Do you have some criticism? (1-2 pages)<br />&bull; Upload your essay as a zip file (including all sources) on Canvas by the deadline.</p>
